    "- The purpose of this notebook is to provide a detailed description so that the technical and business jury can have an overview of the technical and non-technical aspects and how they interconnect.\n",
    "- To use the template, you must make a copy and fill in the team name and the challenge title.\n",
    "- The cells containing the instructions should be deleted, but all headers must be kept.\n",
    "- All technical information should be included in this report (e.g., code, queries, graphs, tools used, parameters, etc.). If necessary, additional files can be added to the OneDrive folder, with references to those files included in this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tip\n",
    "- The technical and business jury will need to evaluate several notebooks, so it’s important to maintain a clear line of thought within the notebook without overloading it with too many similar graphs or visuals that do not add value to the work. On the other hand, it’s important to show that the work done is thorough.\n",
    "- Therefore, we recommend using the annex section to include code that was produced along with its description but might be unnecessary noise for the jury (e.g., tested models that didn’t work, EDA with very similar results between variables, etc.).\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Detailed Movement Tracking\n",
    "A possible issue with the wifi access without anonymization is that we can hypotheticaly track a singular user. An attacker could piece together a user's daily routine by:\n",
    "  - Tracking consistent MAC addresses on the wifi sessions\n",
    "  - Analyzing connection timestamps (`acctstarttime` and `acctsessiontime`)\n",
    "  - Mapping access point locations by correlating with the `callingstationid`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider the following\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  User consistently connects to:\n",
    "  - 7:30 AM: Access Point near home\n",
    "  - 8:00 AM: Access Point near workplace\n",
    "  - 12:30 PM: Access Point in lunch area\n",

    "With the dataset and the identification of the dataset, it's possible for other entities to cross-reference:\n",

    "\n",
    "Considering the threats above we propose the following mitigation strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Minimization**:\n",
    "- Reduce detailed location information (i.e. access points coordinates are approxiamted)\n",
    "- Generalize timestamps (i.e. remove minutes or change date)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Anonymization**:\n",
    "   - Hashing MAC addresses (`callingstationid`)\n",
    "   - Create random session IDs (`acctsessionid`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques allow to remove the direct connection between the access points and the wifi accesses datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consent and Transparency**:\n",
    "   - Clear user consent for data collection\n",
    "   - Opt-out mechanisms\n",
    "   - Detailed privacy policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it doesn't mitigate the risks of approved data this enables the dataset to be given only by consenting users and in this way follow the GDPR which states that we can only store data a given user consents on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Technical Safeguards**:\n",
    "   - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit\n",
    "   - Use secure access controls and authentication mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Monitoring and Auditing**:\n",
    "   - Regularly monitor access to the data and audit logs\n",
    "   - Implement intrusion detection systems\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Incident Response Plan**:\n",
    "   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan\n",
    "   - Include steps for notifying affected individuals and regulatory authorities\n",
